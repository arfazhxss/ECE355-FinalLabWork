This project focuses on the development and implementation of a system for measuring the frequencies of the periodic signals from various devices input to a microcontroller. The design incorporates ADC-based signal acquisition, DAC-driven signal generation, precise frequency and resistance calculations, and real-time data visualization via an OLED display. The implementation leverages multiple microcontroller peripherals—GPIO, TIM2, ADC, DAC, and EXTI—to facilitate seamless operation between Function Generator and 555 Timer modes, controlled through a user interface button. Experimental validation demonstrated measurement accuracy within 2\% deviation under standard operating conditions. Technical challenges encompassing signal interference and interrupt timing were resolved through robust synchronization protocols and signal conditioning techniques. The final system architecture exemplifies efficient peripheral utilization and systematic design methodology, while identifying potential enhancements in sampling efficiency and noise reduction strategies.
